Changelog
=========

5.2 - unreleased
--------------------

  * New maintainer: Jiří Janoušek.
  * Added a complete icon set.
  * Added a license field to metadata.json.
  * Script now doesn't assume that it is always executed before a basic structure of a web page is
    loaded. This isn't guaranteed and it leads to an incompatibility with Nuvola Player 3.0.3.
  * Added information about contributing to the script.
  * Adapted to the change of Amazon Music address. Issue: tiliado/nuvola-app-amazon-cloud-player#13
  * Track info parsing has been fixed. Issue: tiliado/nuvola-app-amazon-cloud-player#17
